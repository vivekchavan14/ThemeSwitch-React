## Project Title
React Theme Switcher

## Description
The React Theme Switcher is a simple web application that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. It provides a user interface with a form and a switch button to toggle between the themes.

The application utilizes React and React Context API to manage the theme state and provide it to the components. It uses the useState hook to maintain the current theme state, and the createContext function to create a theme context that can be accessed by child components.

The main features of the React Theme Switcher include:

- Dynamic theme switching: Users can switch between light and dark themes by clicking the switch button.
- Context-based theming: The theme state is managed using React Context API, allowing child components to access and utilize the current theme value.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience across platforms.
